                    became a reality rather than merely a dream in late May, 1999. 
                    Its purpose then, as now, was to reach out to others who may 
                    have information on William Spratling…his life, his silver 
                    designs, his writings, his drawings, and more.&nbsp; I believed 
                    that if I shared the information I had gathered perhaps others 
                    would share their stories, experiences, and knowledge with 
                    me.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I began to collect Spratling 
                    material in early 1971. (I am not, and have never been a dealer. 
                    I couldn’t bear to part with any of these treasures or the 
                    story that goes along with each!)&nbsp; My parents ha<img border="0" src="photos/box3.jpg" width="125" height="152" align="left">d 
                    sent me a $50. check that January for my birthday, and as 
                    I browsed among some lovely silver items in a small local 
                    antique shop, I saw a tall silver cigarette box (Catalog ID 
                    CJ-3 in the website database) marked only with a WS Print 
                    Circle and a Spratling Silver hallmark. I asked the owner 
                    if it was sterling, and she replied &quot;Of course!&nbsp; 
                    It is Spratling Silver!&nbsp; EVERYONE knows Spratling silver!&quot; 
                    I thought the hand crafted design was truly handsome!&nbsp; 
                    Even though there was no &quot;sterling&quot; designation 
                    on the box, I paid $35. for it and took it home - committed 
                    to learn <img border="0" src="photos/ashtray2.jpg" width="132" height="135" align="right"> 
                    about Spratling Silver since EVERYONE else knew all about 
                    it – and I didn’t!. (The following day, I went back for five 
                    individual ashtrays (Catalog ID CN-11 in the website database) 
                    – the only remaining Spratling items the shop owner had.)</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the subsequent thirty plus 
                    years, I have collected (and continue to collect) not only 
                    Spratling's silver designs, but also other Spratling materials 
                    - copper, tin, books, furniture, drawings, etc.&nbsp; As well, 
                    I have amassed boxes of material from my research. Our entire 
                    family became immersed in learning about Spratling’s experiences. 
                    They even joined with me in the search for examples of his 
                    designs. Our older daughter, when she was a student at the 
                    University of Delaware, discovered what quickly became one 
                    of my very favorite Spratling pieces (Catalog ID SDMBox-1 
                    in the website database). It is truly a wonderful – and special 
                    – part of our collection!<img border="0" src="photos/box4tribute_t.jpg" align="left" width="140" height="124"></font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In 1989 I was asked to collaborate 
                    with Ed Forcum in creating a Spratling Hallmark research page 
                    for the Sandy Cederwall and Hal Riney book <i>Spratling Silver</i>, 
                    originally published by Chronicle Books in 1990 – and since 
                    updated and expanded in 2000.. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">During the mid 1990s I finally 
                    decided it was time to begin organizing my wealth of Spratling 
                    information. While I sorted through and tried to make sense 
                    out of my data, even more questions surfaced. None of us who 
                    had pooled our information and shared theories in the past 
                    had answers. It was obviously time to widen the search for 
                    more information, and so I decided to create a website: <a href="http://www.SpratlingSilver.com/">www.SpratlingSilver.com</a>. 
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So many people have responded…people 
                    who knew Spratling well, people who visited his talleres and 
                    purchased silver there, Spratling’s relatives, collectors, 
                    the families of some of the silversmiths who worked in Spratling’s 
                    taller, dealers, people who lived in Mexico during Spratling’s 
                    time, retailers here in the U.S. who carried Spratling Silver, 
                    pre-Columbian collectors, some of Spratling’s colleagues and 
                    more!&nbsp; Because this website can be updated so easily (at least 
                    once a week) I can share new information constantly.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On October 6,&nbsp; 2002, The 
                    San Antonio Museum of Art opened their exhibit entitled <i>Maestros 
                    de Plata: William Spratling and the Mexican Silver Renaissance</i>. 
                    This exhibit is now traveling from San Antonio, Texas to a 
                    number of other U.S. cities during 2003 and 2004. An expanded 
                    exhibit catalogue has been published by Harry C. Abrams, Inc. 
                    and that catalogue includes much new information in addition 
                    to data about the items on loan for the exhibit. It will certainly 
                    be an important reference source for anyone interested in 
                    20<sup>th</sup> century Mexican silver. My research on Spratling’s 
                    hallmarks and the development of his style has been published 
                    as a part of that catalogue.&nbsp; Read more about the Exhibit 
                    and the Catalogue in <a href="currentnews.htm">Current News</a>

                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">My most recent project was to 
                    finally publish<i>Spratling Silver: A Field Guide - Recognizing 
                    a William Spratling Treasure.</i> I'm not sure what my next 
                    &quot;Spratling project&quot; will be. If there are ideas 
                    you have about how to make the learning about - and collecting 
                    of - Spratling materials more helpful, I welcome your thoughts.</font></p>
