              our new book <em><a href="bookstore.htm">Spratling Silver: A Field

              to provide the fundamental knowledge - but only the first step - 
              one needs to determine if the item is <em>possibly</em> a William

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">Always, 
              our initial reason for looking at hallmarks is so that we can determine 
              the name of the designer or silversmith. Too often, however, we 
              have assumed that any Spratling <b>primary hallmark</b> (the mark 
              which identifies Spratling as the designer) is a guarantee of authenticity.&nbsp; 
              Unfortunately, that is not always the case.&nbsp; <strong>Hallmarks 
              alone do not provide conclusive identification for any highly sought 
              after designer's work because they can be too easily copied.&nbsp; 
              Hallmarks are but one of the tools that we must use in determining 
              whether an item was designed by Spratling and actually produced 
              in his workshop during his lifetime.</strong>&nbsp; To learn about 
              the other tools we must consider when evaluating authenticity, refer 
              to <a href="tips.htm">Tips on Collecting.</a></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In William Spratling's 
              autobiography <em>File on Spratling</em> he says &quot;<strong>Worthwhile 
              silver requires</u> that it be identified with the name and reputation 
              of its</strong> <strong>maker</strong>.&quot;&nbsp; Additional hallmarks 
              can provide information about the silver content as well as occasional 
              supplementary information. We are fortunate that our research has 
              provided information that now allows us to be able to use the variation 
              in the small hallmark details to assist us in identifying a date 
              range that the specific item was made as well as confirm details 
              that verify authentication. This information, although not included 
              on this website, can be found in <em><a href="bookstore.htm">Spratling 
              Silver: A Field Guide.</a></em></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">It is important to note 
              that Spratling insisted that <b>every </b>piece of silver that was 
              produced in the Spratling workshop should be hallmarked with the 
              Spratling hallmark/hallmarks in use at that particular time.&nbsp; 
              (It is conceivable that a few items did leave the workshop without 
              hallmarks, but their monetary value should be far less than appropriately 
              marked pieces.)&nbsp; Spratling's maestros and silversmiths never 
              included their own hallmarks or identifying marks on the items made 
              in his workshop&nbsp;&nbsp;Particularly in the case of jewelry made 
              with links, we occasionally find Spratling designs without a <b>primary 
              Spratling hallmark</b>, even though it may have <b>secondary and/or 
              tertiary marks</b>.&nbsp; It is possible that a former owner of 
              the item had links removed to make the item smaller, or to create 
              earrings and it may have been that missing link that bore the <b>primary 
              hallmark</b>.&nbsp; It is often impossible to determine whether 
              such pieces without a Spratling <b>primary mark</b> are missing 
              a link or are copies made during that same period.&nbsp; The prices 
              paid, however, for items without Spratling's <strong>primary hallmark</strong> 
              should be less than those fully marked.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">William Spratling designed 
              and produced silver from 1931 until 1967. Circa 1933 Spratling began 
              to use a hallmarking system that he retained until his death in 
              1967.&nbsp; This hallmarking system included a <b>primary hallmark</b> 
              that identified Spratling as the designer of the item: for instance, 
              the mark <i><b>WS Print</b></i>.&nbsp; A <b>secondary hallmark</b> 
              identified the place of manufacture: for instance <i><b>Taxco</b></i>. 
              A <b>tertiary mark</b> specified the silver content of the item: 
              for instance<i> <b>980</b></i><b>.</b> And occasionally, Spratling 
              used an <b>other mark</b> which provided additional information 
              about the piece: for instance <i><b>Conquistador Shield</b></i>. 
              Please note that these designations refer to the <b> type</b> of 
              information provided, not the location of the hallmark on the item.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Secondary</b> and <b>tertiary</b> 
              marks were not unique to Spratling.&nbsp; For instance, the mark 
              <b><i>Taxco</i></b> or <b><i>Taxco</i> <i>Mexico</i></b> or <b><i>Made 
              in Mexico</i></b> does not assure this is a Spratling item unless 
              the <b>primary</b> <strong>mark</strong> is one of Spratling's <b>primary 
              marks</b> appropriate to the period.&nbsp; Likewise, the <strong>tertiary 
              marks</strong> <b><i>925</i> </b>or <i><b>980</b></i> are not indicative 
              of a Spratling design unless the <b>primary mark</b> is an appropriate 
              Spratling mark.&nbsp;The dies used to produce these specific <strong>secondary 
              and tertiary marks</strong> were available to everyone who wanted 
              to purchase them.&nbsp; They are NOT indicative of a specific silversmith 
              or designer.&nbsp; You can see that the most important mark is the 
              <b>primary mark</b> because it is that mark that identifies Spratling 
              as the designer.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Over the last 30+ years, 
              many of his designs (and adaptations of his designs) have continued 
              to be produced by the Sucesores de William Spratling and even today 
              are available from them as new pieces. Recently, others have started 
              to produce &quot;new&quot; Spratling designs as well.&nbsp; But 
              we must remember that many of Spratling's designs were also copied 
              at the time Spratling was producing them.&nbsp; (He often said that 
              his designs had an &quot;exclusive&quot; time frame of only about 
              three weeks.)&nbsp; Rarely did those copies produced during the 
              1940s, 1950s, and 1960s also copy Spratling's hallmarks.&nbsp; Instead 
              those designs may have been marked with the silversmith's name or 
              initials, &quot;Mexico Silver&quot;, or any other name. It has been 
              primarily during the last thirty years that Spratling's hallmarks 
              have been deliberately copied.&nbsp; (One of the easiest ways to 
              identify many non authentic Spratling items is to know what groups 
              of hallmarks (<b>primary, secondary, tertiary, and other marks</b>) 
              were used together.&nbsp; During Spratling&#146;s lifetime, he changed 
              the <b> primary hallmark</b> (and combinations of hallmarks) a number 
              of times. Usually such changes occurred when the company increased 
              or decreased its size or changed its structure or format. By knowing 
              when each hallmark (or hallmark grouping)&nbsp; was used, we can 
              then deduce approximately when a particular object was produced.&nbsp; 
              In addition, the dies used to stamp the hallmark on the silver item 
              needed to be replaced occasionally, and the variations in these 
              hand made dies also help to refine date ranges.&nbsp;&nbsp;For more 
              information about - and photos of - these variations, refer to my 
              book, <em><a href="bookstore.htm">Spratling Silver: A Field Guide</a></em> 
              pages 31 - 33. Extensive additional hallmark information that is 
              not included on this website can be found throughout the book.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The photographs below 
              of hallmarks found on silver designed by William Spratling are arranged 
              in chronological groupings. These photographs were taken from actual 
              objects.&nbsp; Please remember that there will always be variation 
              in marks due to wearing of dies, slight differences in die manufacture, 
              amount and&nbsp; uniformity of the pressure applied when stamping, 
              etc. Some items may have several marks; others may have only one. 
              And the same design may be found with earlier or later &quot;sets&quot; 
              of hallmarks <b>from the same design period </b>indicating that 
              the design was produced over a number of years.&nbsp; As we continue 
              our research, we hope to be able to better understand the usage 
              of each of these marks and better determine the specific time frames. 
              We are grateful for your information and feedback!&nbsp;</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">These <b> primary marks</b> 
              pictured directly below are the earliest hallmarks Spratling used 
              and are arranged in chronological order.&nbsp;The time frame for 
              these three hallmarks was circa 1931 until early 1940.&nbsp; Items 
              with these marks were made of silver and occasionally included other

              amethyst in his designs, and thus, the earliest <b>primary hallmark</b> 
              we would expect to find on any Spratling design that includes amethyst 
              would be the <b><i>WS Print Later</i></b> .&nbsp; During this period, 
              Spratling also produced household items of wood, copper and tin.&nbsp;

              Brand</b></i> mark (inspired by the brand that Spratling used on

              tertiary mark</b> was generally used on all jewelry and tea strainers.&nbsp; 
              Spratling said that 980 silver had a softer glow and complemented 
              a woman's skin when used in jewelry. 980 silver also is more resistant 
              to tarnish. <i><b>925 </b></i>silver, because of its greater copper 
              content, has greater strength - an important factor when used for 
              household objects. The <strong>925 mark</strong> generally appeared

              created the <b>primary hallmark</b>, <i><b>WS Print Circle.</b></i>&nbsp; 
              This <b>primary mark</b> was used from circa 1940 until circa 1946

              decreed that the eagle hallmark was to be used for all items created 
              for export and would guarantee that the items was of sterling quality. 
              Within the eagle mark was specific number that was to be assigned 
              to each applying silver manufacturing entity. That number would 
              identify the silversmith or designer of that particular item. Silversmiths 
              or designers who did not apply for their own number could have their 
              silver items stamped with the &quot;generic&quot; eagle of their 
              community. Mexico City was assigned the generic eagle number 1, 
              Taxco was assigned number 3, etc.&nbsp; This system was in effect 
              from early 1949 until, we believe, circa 1979. The numbers within 
              the eagle hallmark that were assigned to Spratling and were used 
              in combination with the specific Spratling <b>primary mark</b> of 
              the period were <b><i>13</i>, <i> and later, 30</i>,</b> and <i> 
              <b> 63</b></i> - all of which were specifically assigned to Spratling 
              for his use during<strong> very specific</strong> years.&nbsp; (Occasionally, 
              we find an Eagle 1 used in combination with Spratling's primary 
              hallmark.&nbsp; These items are either old Spratling designs (circa 
              1944 - 1946 that remained in a Mexico City retailer's inventory 
              until 1949 and were subsequently stamped with the generic Mexico 
              City Eagle number prior to export or, in each known instance to 
              date, was used on a single Spratling 1950 design.)&nbsp; These numbers 
              (<b><i>13, 30,</i></b> and<i><b> 63</b></i>) were never reassigned 
              to another silversmith.&nbsp; Thus, for example, even after Spratling's 
              death, the <i><b> Eagle 63</b></i> was not given to another silversmith.&nbsp; 
              The number (and its authentic stamp) was retired permanently.</font></p>

              <i>Eagle 13 </i></b>only.&nbsp; We would then know that the item

              ranch, while the item bearing the &quot;<b>other</b>&quot; <b><i>Conquistador

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Spratling signed the original 
              contract with Conquistador on January 1, 1949. Conquistador was 
              to be responsible for all production and marketing of a special 
              group of up to 300 Spratling designs, and in return, Spratling was 
              to be paid specified royalties.&nbsp; Conquistador amended the contract 
              several times.&nbsp; (One change involved Conquistador's inability 
              to live up to the production quantities specified in their contract, 
              which was why Spratling also began to produce these new designs 
              at his ranch at Taxco el Viejo.)&nbsp; In November 1950, Spratling's 
              attorney notified Conquistador that Spratling was canceling their 
              contract because of Conquistador's inability to meet production 
              levels, lack of marketing, and probably most importantly, that Conquistador 
              had not made the specified royalty payments.&nbsp; Spratling's attorney 
              told Conquistador that they had permission to continue to use Spratling's 
              <b>primary <i>Spratling de Mexico</i></b> hallmark ONLY for those 
              items in production at that moment.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Conquistador 
              continued to produce the Spratling designs until the contract was 
              finally cancelled. During the time from late 1950 when Conquistador 
              could no longer use the <b><i>Spratling de Mexico </i></b>mark until 
              the contract was actually cancelled (probably very early 1952), 
              Conquistador produced the Spratling designs using their own hallmark 
              as a <b>primary </b>mark with Spratling's <b>tertiary <i>Eagle 13. 
              </i></b> It is likely that the later production of these Spratling 
              designs was not authorized, but collectors value these Spratling 
              designs marked with the <strong>Conquistador Shield Sterling Mexico</strong> 
              as highly as those marked with the <strong>Spratling de Mexico primary 
              mark</strong>. Conquistador also produced <em>modified </em>Spratling 
              designs as well as <em>their own designs </em>and used <strong>Spratling's 
              Eagle 13 tertiary mark</strong> along with Conquistador's hallmark 
              that spells out the name &quot;Conquistador.&quot; These Conquistador 
              designs and items appear to be not valued by Spratling collectors.

              the period of time before a new Eagle mark was issued to Spratling,

              basics remain the same. The lettering around the circumference of 
              the circle was hand done and irregular. Contrast the <b> correct hallmark 
              on the right</b> with the regularity of lettering around the circle 
              in the photo of the fake hallmark on the left.&nbsp; The left photo is that of a hallmark 
              that appeared on several Spratling items offered at a Dan Ripley 
              auction in September 1998.&nbsp; After careful evaluation, it was 
              determined that the pieces stamped with this hallmark (photo on 
              left) had NOT been made during Spratling's lifetime, and those items 
              were removed from the auction.&nbsp; Thank you! to Dan 
              Ripley for having the courage to ask authenticity questions about 
              his auction&nbsp;merchandise and for his willingness to share his

              on the right have been found <i>together</i> on a number of pieces 
              of Spratling jewelry.&nbsp;<b>These two marks were NEVER used together!&nbsp;They 
              are from two different time periods!&nbsp; </b>This illustrates 
              why it is so important to know more about the <b> usage</b> and 
              <b>time frame</b> of each hallmark.&nbsp; It is not enough to just 
              see the familiar WS mark on an item. The <i><b>WS Print Brand</b></i> 
              mark has been seen only rarely and, in each case, was used alone.&nbsp; 
              This mark apparently has been copied from a photo in the book <i>Mexican 
              Silver</i> (page 33) by Morrill and Berk. The photograph as it appears 
              in the book shows the single <i><b>WS Print Brand</b></i> mark as 
              the only hallmark on a very early (and unique example) of a pendant 
              given by Spratling to Ms. Morrill's grandmother.&nbsp; Note the 
              perfect regularity in the letters in the oval cartouche <b> <i>Spratling 
              Silver</i>.</b>&nbsp; They appear to have been printed by machine 
              rather than the hand done letters in the authentic oval cartouche

              The letters and numbers in the other marks appear to be machine

            initials in the center of this mark are another application of the

              horizontal) &quot;M&quot; in the words Made and Mexico.&nbsp; Contrast 
              it with the authentic mark on the right.&nbsp; The fake mark shows 
              two silver rivets that are a part of the construction of the particular 
              piece this mark appeared on.&nbsp; However those rivets have nothing 
              to do with the non authentic elements of the hallmark.</font></p>

              to study the elements consistent in authentic hallmarks so that 
              we can learn to recognize those authentic marks from each period. 
              That hallmark information, in conjunction with the analysis of design, 
              scale, proportion, materials, weight, construction, and pattern
