Site was hosted with Neocom from 1999 until June 30, 2023.
Then I migrated it to Hostinger.com using their virtual private server VPS 2 service.
There were lots of choices of operating system for the server.  I chose Ubuntu 22.04
with no control panel since that is what I am most familiar with.  It has a static
IP address 5.183.8.229.  Apache2 was already installed.  I installed php and sqlite3
and emacs as root and restarted the server

   apt update
   apt install php libapache2-mod-php sqlite3 php-sqlite3 emacs
   service apache restart
   
The web site files are in

   /var/www/html

I didn't set up a virtual host in apache.

After I switch the spratlingsilver.com DNS records to point to the new site I should
also get an SSL certificate so https works.  Here are instructions for that
