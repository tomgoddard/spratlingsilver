        <p><i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
        It seems like only a few
        weeks ago that I designed the article Phyllis Goddard wrote for us,
        "William Spratling Hallmarks: A More Detailed Look at His Early
        Hallmarks." It is with profound sadness that I now find myself
        designing this page in memory of Phyllis, a truly inspiring presence; a
        person of great integrity, kindness of spirit, passion, and unwavering
        dedication to uncovering all there was to know about William Spratling,
        his work, and his hallmarks.&nbsp;</font></font></i></p>
        <p><i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Her support of MODERN SILVER
        magazine and SilverForum, and her constant willingness to help other
        collectors find answers to their questions about Spratling silver were
        things I began to take for granted--she was always there when we
        needed her.&nbsp;Phyllis passed away on January 2,
        2004 from a virulent form of pneumonia. We miss her deeply!</font></i></p>

        <p align="center"><b><font face="Arial"><font color="#990000">Below are remembrances of Phyllis
        Goddard<br>
        &nbsp;from
        members of <i> SilverForum</i></font></b><br>

        <p align="left"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phyllis was a vibrant, enthusiastic, positive, dynamic, focused,
        proactive, generous, kind and supportive person. There aren't enough
        adjectives to describe her. Her favorite word was "fun."
        Everything she did was done because she thought it was "fun" -
        her collection, her web site, her book. She learned to do "techy"
        things like digital photography, PowerPoint, web site creation and
        administration, all because they furthered her passion for her Spratling
        collection, and her desire to share what she knew with the collecting
        public. That was how she had fun!<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phyllis' attention to detail was astonishing, as was her ability to
        organize information. That is readily apparent on her web site. These
        talents became even more obvious to me when I worked with her on her
        book. She was always concerned with "getting it right,"
        something I could well appreciate. But she was also always supportive of
        the work of others, including mine.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was taken from us too soon. I am glad that she was able to be a part
        of the "new renaissance" of Mexican silver and the exhibition,
        see her idea for a book come to fruition, self-publish it - and sell it
        like hotcakes! I am sad that her latest idea - for a hands-on workshop
        for collectors - was not realized.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will be sorely missed.</font></i></p>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phyllis Goddard's untimely death is a great loss. As a recent and
          modest Mexican silver collector, I&nbsp;have depended on Phyllis's web
          site as a terrific educational resource. Her responses to inquiries on
          SilverForum were always informative, and her recent books a great
          contribution to our information and understanding. I agree with you,
          though, that it was her generosity of spirit combined with her
          knowledge, that made her extraordinary. She helped me acquire out of
          print reference materials, and her warmth shone through our email
          correspondence. Phyllis, we will miss you.</i></font>

Phyllis was a great help to me many times. I contacted her personally
only 2 or 3 times, but she responded to questions I had on Silver Forum
many more times than that and always gave me a great feeling of relief
and assurance that "she knew her stuff".&nbsp; I loved the way she
looked for the truth in her research.&nbsp; She "knew" what you wanted
to hear, but she wanted her research to be valid and correct.&nbsp; She
was a wonderful person and such a resource to the Mexican silver
community especially to Spratling lovers.&nbsp; I don't know how we'll
get along without her.&nbsp; It is such a loss!<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had the opportunity to meet Phyllis and hear her lecture on her
        beloved Spratling in San Antonio, Texas at the Maestros de Plata
        exposition.&nbsp; I can only say that Phyllis surpassed the image I had
        of
        her in my mind's eye. She was a beautiful, warm and gracious woman who
        "knew her stuff" and was open and giving in sharing it.&nbsp;
        Her family was
        so proud of her.&nbsp; That is a wonderful thing in itself that she was
        loved
        by her peers and the Spratling Silver world, but even more loved by her
        family. She related the story of how she began collecting Spratling and
        it brought it all home to me because when a family can share a love of a
        collection, it makes it all the more special.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I join all members of this community in mourning the loss of a wonderful
        woman and a great Silver Historian.<br>

        The news about Phyllis upset me also although I can't say I knew her
        personally.&nbsp; As soon as her book came out, I ordered it immediately
        and
        mentioned how I felt so ignorant about trying to acquire a true
        Spratling item for my personal collection.&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't simply
        confirm
        my order, she wrote me a short encouraging note with a very friendly
        tone to it and made me feel as though
        I were an old friend of hers.&nbsp; I thought she would be around for a
        long
        time yet to help and advise others who share her love for Mexican
        silver.&nbsp; Once again we are reminded that no one knows what tomorrow
        holds for any of us.&nbsp;&nbsp; In my mind I imagine her now sitting
        down with
        Spratling to ask him all those unanswered questions she had!<br>
