                  pterodactyl with a fat hiny, Mommy&quot; shouted my four
                  year-old Axel when I told him that the 1930's Cessna on the
                  photograph was called the 'Pájaro nalgón.'&nbsp; His
                  paternal great-grandfather, Moisés Sáenz, stood proudly next
                  to it wearing his aviator hat.&nbsp; When 20 years later my
                  son and daughter asked to see the photograph again, my father
                  responded that it was long discarded in one of my mother's
                  'nesting impulses.'</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;What is it
                  with wings and this family?&quot; my children asked me
                  later.&nbsp; I said I had no idea what they were talking
                  about.&nbsp; &quot;Cessnas, nesting-impulses, and bats, for
                  God's sake!&nbsp; come on, Mom, this is totally weird.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I hadn't realized
                  that as my children grew up they were regaled with stories -
                  pretty ordinary ones as far as I was concerned - about the
                  days I had spent as a child at my parents' beach house <i>Quinta
                  los murciélagos.&nbsp; </i>It was then that I figured out for
                  the first time that <i>Los murciélagos</i>, the 'Bat Villa' -
                  that haven on the water on the coast of Guerrero - was seen by
                  all but us who dwelled in it, as a ship of fools.&nbsp; And it
                  was in such a ship, not surprisingly, that Bill Spratling and
                  his Cessna occasionally came to roost.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">My Grandpa, my
                  Dad, and Bill used their Cessnas to scare the living daylights
                  out of anyone who climbed on board, but Robin and Felicity
                  Thomas used theirs as a business: they flew dead Americans for
                  a living.&nbsp; Their company <i>Sarcófagos Aéreos, S.A. </i>prospered
                  during the high seasons and tides, and floundered during the
                  low.&nbsp; I have no idea how they landed at our beach house
                  in Acapulco in the late 50s, but they did.&nbsp; After all, it
                  was common for strange birds to land and take-off from the Bat
                  Villa all the time.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The house got its
                  name from the hundreds of bats that flew in at dusk from <i>La
                  Roqueta</i>, a beautiful island right across the channel
                  connecting the Acapulco Bay to Boca Chica and Boca Grande, the
                  two main gateways to the Pacific Ocean.&nbsp; The bats would
                  glide in at dusk and hang up-side-down from the wooden beams
                  of the Quinta to spend the night; they would depart at
                  dawn.&nbsp; So did the French engineer named Michel Kuhn - who
                  chose as his perch the master beam across the living room -
                  and whom we, the children, feared because he dined on our fish
                  bait decades before sushi was fashionable.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Phyllias LaLanne
                  showed great contempt for the French engineer perched on the
                  master beam.&nbsp; Unlike the 'Frog,' as he called him under
                  his breath, Phylllias was a vegetarian who consumed only
                  cucurbits, having learned the great virtues of this diet
                  during his time in India as an officer in the Raj. He
                  supplemented his diet of watermelon rinds with an English
                  fortifier called Whitavim that, when mixed with Gin, had a
                  much more nourishing effect - pour me equal parts, sweet
                  child.&nbsp; He, too, refused a bedroom, and preferred to show
                  his mettle by camping out in our gardens sheltered by an
                  'excellent' standard-issue pre-partition British government
                  tent.&nbsp; He was, of course, a naturalist shaped and molded
                  by Darwinian shoes.&nbsp; As such, he would wake up at dawn,
                  dress in his white army uniform and Saharakopf, and lacking a
                  bugle, would blow on a conch-shell to wake up the
                  children.&nbsp; With sleep on our eyes - but with smiles the
                  size of corn-on-the-cob - we would follow our pied piper of
                  Guerrero to harvest the ripest mangoes, persimmons, almonds,
                  and papayas from the orchard.&nbsp; Afternoons were joyfully
                  spent stringing and hanging the ripened fruits from the wooden
                  beams throughout the old house for the bats to break their
                  fast at dawn.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">But splendid
                  breakfasts were not only reserved for those winged
                  creatures.&nbsp; There was another strange bird that often
                  flew to Bat Villa on his Cessna.&nbsp; He came to us with
                  buckets full of fresh frogs for a delightful meal for
                  all.&nbsp; &quot;Bonifacia, buona faccia, bella faz, bello
                  rostro, beautiful-faced woman!&nbsp; I am here!&nbsp; Where
                  art thou?&quot; he would shout in order to have Bonifacia Nava,
                  the cook, come out and shower Tata Beel with hugs and
                  kisses.&nbsp; And so, with a muddy splash, would land Bill
                  Spratling at <i>Los murciélagos</i>.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;You are NOT
                  taking the children up for a spin&quot; my Mom cried
                  adamantly.&nbsp; &quot;Bill,&quot; she earnestly pronounced,
                  &quot;I made my husband give up his Cessna when I got
                  pregnant.&nbsp; After I had my first child I trusted you and
                  flew with you at the wheel, or stern, or cockpit, or whatever
                  the blasted thing is called, to go see that turquoise mask in
                  the mountains...and you purposefully flew the damn bird
                  up-side-down, like the bats on the beams at <i>Los
                  murciélagos</i>, and I peed in my pants.&nbsp; The children
                  stay put.&nbsp; I stay put.&nbsp; My husband stays put.&nbsp;
                  You go on and kill yourself over the Roqueta if you so damn
                  please, but you are not taking any of us with you.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Right you
                  are, deah Jacqueline,&quot; Phyllias rallied in my Mom's
                  support.&nbsp; &quot;Theeze Ahmehricans are nought to be
                  trustid.&nbsp; The only claim to fame William has is that he
                  is willing to eat frogs.&nbsp; God help us; he is no different
                  from the Frog on the beam eating the children's bait.&nbsp; We
                  ought to teach this William chap the difference between a
                  'frog' with a lowercase 'f' and one with an uppercase
                  'F.'&nbsp; If he were to dine on the uppercase ones, he would
                  then, perhaps, join the ranks of civilized man.&nbsp; Good
                  thing is, my dear, should anything happen, there's always
                  England to rely upon.&nbsp; Robin and Felicity will give their
                  best in the name of the Crown to ensure a dignified transport
                  and I - in the name of the British government - promise to
                  give all those who perish at the hands of this barbarian, and
                  even the barbarian himself if he insists on defying the laws
                  of nature, an honorable burial, in the full glory of the
                  British tradition.&nbsp; Hail, hail.&nbsp; 'Nough said, my
                  deah.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The phone rang on
                  a gray afternoon at my parents' Mexico City home.&nbsp; I must
                  have been about five or six, so I don't know who it was that
                  called.&nbsp; All I remember is my mother hanging up, in
                  tears, and calling my father at work.&nbsp; &quot;That
                  fool,&quot; my mother said, &quot;he took off from Iguala and
                  crashed somewhere in the Sierra.&nbsp; Not a trace of him or
                  the plane.&quot;&nbsp; And I wept, and my mother mourned, and
                  the bells of Santa Prisca tolled, and then Bill strolled back
                  into Taxco a month later, torn and tattered, but whole.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">But my mother was
                  wrong.&nbsp; It was not the skies who were to claim Spratling,
                  but a felled tree on the road.&nbsp; On August 7, 1967 the
                  bells of Santa Prisca finally tolled for Bill.&nbsp; At the
                  funeral, '<i>la muda,'</i> an Indian woman from Iguala who
                  sold pre-Columbian art both to Bill and my parents, took my
                  hand and my mother's and placed them on Bill's feet.&nbsp; She
                  then said &quot;para que tenga buen camino&quot; so he may
                  have an easy road ahead.&nbsp; Phyllias had passed on and
                  could not say his farewells to 'that William chap,' and Robin
                  and Felicity were not there to ensure a 'dignified transport,'
                  but we all knew that Bill's spirit and legacy had wings of
                  their own and soared without the need of a Cessna.&nbsp; I
                  miss the rascal.</font></p>

                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Amidst the fires of Don Guillermo's 
                    workshop stumbled a boy with eyes the color of tamarind seeds 
                    who dreamed of ladling <i>caldos and pipianes</i>, not streams 
                    of liquid silver, into a myriad beautiful molds. But it wasn't 
                    so much that To&ntilde;o wanted to become a cook, as much 
                    as Rancho Viejo wanted to become a kitchen. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The orchard's narrow paths were 
                    pungent with the perfumes of citrus; the trees pregnant with 
                    soursop, mango, and guava; the fruit of the tamarind trees 
                    fell into the frog ponds as if ready to be steeped for a refreshing drink; delicious purslane filled the cracks of 
                    the reservoir; huauhzontle and rosemaries hugged the masonry 
                    walls of the old house, and as the banana and plantain trees 
                    yielded their fruit, their leaves, fresh and pliant, were 
                    ready for making tamales. All of Rancho Viejo was begging 
                    for a cook and To&ntilde;o heard its call.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Early one morning To&ntilde;o 
                    found me playing by the frog pond. &quot;Don Guillermo,&quot; 
                    he whispered while pointing his index finger to his temple 
                    and moving it in circles as we sipped our freshly squeezed<i> 
                    jugo de lima, &quot;est&aacute; un poco loco</i>. He has this 
                    crazy idea and wants me to cook those frogs for lunch.&quot; 
                    And so it was that I had my first of many gourmet meals at 
                    Bill's table: Frog legs &agrave; la To&ntilde;o and &quot;airbread,&quot; 
                    or <i>pan de puro aire</i>, as To&ntilde;o would call Bill's 
                    sinful popovers, to soak up the <i>cuisses de grenouille's</i> 
                    garlicky Proven&ccedil;al sauce.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Bill's table out on the porch 
                    was nothing if not humble. It was pockmarked, rickety, and 
                    a little unsteady. It was the sort of table one sees in Mexico 
                    all the time: downright ordinary. It was rectangular and sat 
                    a maximum of 8 people on equally unpretentious (and uncomfortable) 
                    chairs. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Then one day, some twenty years 
                    after Bill's death, I was preparing a talk on contemporary 
                    Mexican painters for an art history class when in the slide
                  library at the university I came across 
                    a photograph of David Alfaro Siqueiros, Diego Rivera and Andr&eacute; 
                    Breton.&nbsp; I checked it 
                    out along with several other slides depicting the work of 
                    Mexico's great muralists and painters. When I gave my talk 
                    and saw the slide blown up, I started stuttering. There they 
                    were, these three great men, sitting at the pockmarked, rickety 
                    and unsteady table I knew so well and had taken for granted. 
                    I realized immediately that I was but a child when I knew 
                    Bill, and obviously could not tell an ordinary table from 
                    the extraordinary one that he had set out on his porch at 
                    Rancho Viejo. </font><br>
