      <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This database contains information on more 
        than 800 specific Spratling items. There are photos, descriptions, hallmarks, 
        dimensions, original Spratling catalog number (if known), and references 
        pertaining to each specific item. If you have additional information, 
        will you please share it via either the Comment section or the Forum?</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>A Simple Search: </b></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the ITEM box, scroll through and click 
          once on whatever category (pin, letter opener, etc.) you would like 
          to search. Scroll down the page and click on SEARCH DATABASE. If you 
          see a small photo and you would like more information on that item, 
          click on the photo or the ID number. You will then go to the information 
          page for that item.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">You can search for more than one ITEM by 
          clicking once on the first choice, scrolling to the second choice, and 
          hold down the control key at the same time you click on the second choice. 
          Scroll down the page and click on SEARCH DATABASE.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you change your mind and wish to make 
          new selections, scroll down the page and click on RESET.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>A More Selective Search:</b></font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> You can select additional criteria other 
          than just ITEM by clicking once on a specific MATERIAL and/or PRIMARY 
          HALLMARK, SECONDARY HALLMARK, TERTIARY HALLMARK, ADDITIONAL HALLMARK. 
          The process is the same as above in the Simple Search. (The only individual 
          box in which you can make more than one concurrent selection, is the 
          ITEM box.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Example:</b> In the ITEM box, click 
          on Bracelet. Scroll to the MATERIAL box and click on Amethyst. Scroll 
          to the PRIMARY HALLMARK box and click on WS Print Circle. Scroll to 
          the TERTIARY HALLMARK box and click on Spratling Silver. Scroll to SEARCH 
          DATABASE and click. You will have found all Spratling bracelets in the 
          database that include amethyst and have both the hallmarks WS Print 
          Circle and Spratling Silver.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Catalog Number Search: </b></font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"> If you know the original Spratling wholesale 
          catalog number (the current reissue catalog does not always use the 
          original Spratling numbers) you can go directly to the Catalog Number 
          Search and insert the number.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Example:</b> Type in catalog number 
          BOMB-1. Scroll down to SEARCH DATABASE and click.</font></p>
