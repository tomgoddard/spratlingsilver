        know about what we collect, the more we enjoy it!&nbsp; Certainly with the availability of
        items designed by William Spratling and their increasing cost, it is more important than
        ever to be able to evaluate those items of interest.&nbsp; There are very few sellers who
        would deliberately mislead, but it is unreasonable to expect dealers to be experts in
        every area of merchandise they sell.&nbsp; We often find Spratling treasures in flea
        markets, estate sales, and auctions where we must depend upon our own ability to judge the
        merits and authenticity of a piece. &nbsp; What should we look for?</font></p>

                  the two is often the easiest way to discern copies! <em><a href="bookstore.htm">Spratling

                  as others, there was a fairly high level of workmanship required 
                  before &quot;maestro approval&quot; was obtained. Construction

                  </strong>Successful designs of jewelry and objects were <em>always</em> 
                  copied, and although a design may be a &quot;Spratling&quot; 
                  design, unless it is <i>authentically</i> hallmarked as such 
                  with a Spratling <b>primary hallmark</b> of the correct period, 
                  or there is irrefutable documented provenance, it cannot be 
                  considered as having the same value as an appropriately hallmarked 
                  piece.&nbsp; Hallmarks, however, can be added or newly created, 
                  so it is essential that we look beyond the fact that a Spratling 
                  hallmark appears on the item.&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">(It 
                  is even possible to photograph &quot;correct&quot; hallmarks 
                  and have dies made that will reproduce the photographed images 
                  on non authentic items.)</span>&nbsp; It is important to remember 
                  that the lettering on each of the authentic Spratling hallmarks 
                  was hand done.&nbsp; Therefore we find an irregularity in the 
                  spacing and placement of the letters, particularly in the <i> 
                  <strong>WS Print Circle</strong></i><strong> hallmark</strong> 
                  (photo on the left.)&nbsp; There are copies on the market today 
                  wherein the lettering on this hallmark is so perfect and regular 
                  it appears to have been created by a machine as in the &quot;fake&quot; 
                  hallmark on the right.&nbsp; <b>In the <i>WS Print Circle</i> 
                  mark, the letters surrounding the circle were raised while the 
                  <i>WS</i> in the center was incised (cut into) into the silver.&nbsp; 
                  The <i>Spratling Silver</i> letters were raised in the oval 
                  cartouche.&nbsp; (The photographs do not always adequately show 
                  the difference between the incised and raised letters.)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                  <img border="0" src="photos/Hallmarks_Fake_Authentic_Print_Circle.jpg" align="right" width="294" height="164">More 
                  examples of Spratling silver are appearing on the market with 
                  a<strong> <i>WS Print Circle</i> hallmark </strong>in which 
                  the <em>center letters,</em> &quot;WS&quot; have been stamped 
                  more than once thus blurring the center part of the image.&nbsp; 
                  These marks are highly suspicious since the entire hallmark 
                  stamp (punch) was a single unit.&nbsp; Therefore, if the center 
                  letters were struck twice the letters on the outer rim should 
                  also have been struck twice.&nbsp; On some of the examples we 
                  are seeing now, only the center is struck twice.&nbsp; (It is 
                  true that entire stamps were sometimes moved in the process 
                  and thus, two overlapping marks are created.&nbsp; But the entire 
                  mark is affected - not merely the center letters.)&nbsp; Spratling 
                  used a variety of hallmarks (each with a fairly definable time 
                  span), and so we need to assess whether the <strong>design</strong> 
                  of the specific item in question correlates with the time frame 
                  that particular <strong>hallmark</strong> was used.&nbsp; For 
                  example, most of Spratling's jewelry incorporating copper or 
                  bronze were made prior to 1946.&nbsp; If you refer to the section 
                  on this website <a href="hallmarks.htm">Hallmarks - What Do 
                  They Mean?</a> you will see that the <b> primary hallmarks</b> 
                  <i> <strong>WS Print</strong></i><strong>, <i> WS Print Later</i>, 
                  <i> WS Print Circle</i>, and <i> Spratling Silver</i></strong> 
                  were used during the time frame circa 1933 until circa 1946. 
                  &nbsp; Therefore we would expect to see one of these <img border="0" src="photos/pin2_t.jpg" align="left" width="140" height="140">hallmarks 
                  on a Spratling piece which incorporates copper or bronze. Another 
                  example of the relation of hallmarks to Spratling design and 
                  period of production is that we should be concerned if we find 
                  a design we know was made only after 1950 if it has a circa 
                  1940 - 1946 hallmark. The dragonfly pin shown on the right would 
                  be of concern if it had a hallmark like that pictured above 
                  on the right. Instead, the dragonfly pin should have one of 
                  the hallmarks used during the 1950s and 1960s.&nbsp; See the 
                  <a href="hallmarks.htm">Hallmark</a> section for more information 
                  and photos of those marks.</font></p>

                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>DESIGN</strong>&nbsp; 
                  Spratling designs have a bold clarity that is consistent throughout 
                  the entire 1931 - 1967 period.&nbsp; His early designs reflect 
                  ranch &quot;rope&quot; patterns, straps, and designs with heavy 
                  incised carving or cut out work based on pre-Columbian motifs. 
                  Spratling also created a distinctive, light weight repousse 
                  body of work representative of stylized pre-Columbian and Hispanic 
                  motifs.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the early 1940s Spratling combined many 
                  of his silver designs with native stones and materials thus 
                  creating surface and textural contrast.&nbsp; After 1947, his 
                  designs became simpler with greater emphasis on line, surface, 
                  and the interplay of light and shadow.&nbsp; He combined indigenous 
                  materials of strong contrast with silver so that he could further 
                  emphasize the sculptural lines of his refined design ethic.&nbsp; 
                  In the late 1940's Spratling was working on his project to train 
                  young Alaskan men to fabricate silver to be used in combination 
                  with their own indigenous materials, and as a part of that project, 
                  Spratling created 200 protoype models. &nbsp;Although the project 
                  never developed beyond the initial training of 7 men in 1949, 
                  Spratling had visited Alaska a number of times and was impressed 
                  with the similarity of early cultures among the Alaskans, Northwest 
                  Coast Indians and pre-Columbian civilizations.&nbsp; A significant 
                  number of Spratling's designs created during this period are 
                  influenced by this &quot;Alaskan experience.&quot;&nbsp; In 
                  the late 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s he created many designs executed 
                  in gold and other materials that reflected ideas inspired by 
                  his time spent in Alaska.&nbsp; He also continued to produce 
                  jewelry combined with ebony and pre-Columbian jade.&nbsp;Throughout 
                  the evolution of Spratling's design spectrum, several themes 
                  are ever present.&nbsp; The use of applied and inset circles 
                  (of both silver and other materials), the depiction of animals 
                  and birds, and the use of a single or clasped hands as a design 
                  element can be found in every one of Spratling's design periods 
                  from 1931 until his death in 1967.&nbsp; </font></p>

                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>MATERIALS 
                  USED</strong>&nbsp; A study of Spratling's catalogues and writings 
                  clearly shows that he favored the combination and use of specific 
                  materials at various periods in his designing career.&nbsp; 
                  This too, can be additional confirmation in assigning date ranges 
                  for a specific item.&nbsp;Extensive information and photos of 
                  designs with the materials used in each design period can be 
                  found in <em><a href="bookstore.htm">Spratling Silver: A Field 
                  Guide</a></em>.</font></p>

                  Even the most recent of Spratling's pieces made during his lifetime 
                  is more than 35 years old.&nbsp; We should expect to find appropriate 
                  <i><strong>evidence of age and usage</strong></i> on the surface 
                  of each piece.&nbsp; Even with the best of care, silver shows 
                  small scratches which, to a connoisseur, define the essence 
                  of <strong>patina</strong>.&nbsp; <img border="0" src="photos/patina.jpg" align="right" width="140" height="129">Don't 
                  confuse <i>tarnish</i> with patina. This patination comes from 
                  usage, from polishing, and from exposure to air and is highly 
                  desirable! Unfortunately, some older&nbsp; pieces have been 
                  mechanically buffed to produce a &quot;like new&quot; surface.&nbsp; 
                  Even when that has taken place, a diligent inspection should 
                  show areas in crevices, turnings, etc., where no buffing wheel 
                  could reach.&nbsp; Without such evidence, it may be that this 
                  really is a newly created piece.&nbsp; There are very very few 
                  items that were purchased 44+ years ago and remained&nbsp; sealed 
                  in an air tight material and never unwrapped. The ashtray on 
                  the right shows the normal patination we would expect.&nbsp; 
                  (Remember however, that patina can be acquired with only a few 
                  years of usage. A lovely mellow patina does not guarantee age. 
                  It does tell us that the item is not brand new.) </font></p>

                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>CONSTRUCTION</strong>&nbsp; 
                  Spratling's construction techniques remained fairly consistent 
                  throughout the 1931 to 1967 period.&nbsp; Indeed there were 
                  improvements in machinery which enabled the silversmiths to 
                  be more efficient, but generally, boxes were constructed in 
                  the same way, hinges and their attachment are consistent,<img border="0" src="photos/rivit.jpg" align="right" width="140" height="97"> 
                  joining of, or insetting wood to silver shows the same method 
                  of attachment (note photo showing silver rivet joining silver 
                  and wood), and necklace and bracelet fasteners did not vary 
                  within their own time frame.&nbsp; <img border="0" src="photos/file_mark.jpg" align="left" width="200" height="125">Therefore, 
                  we should see consistency in these details.&nbsp; Many of Spratling's 
                  early bracelet designs (1933 - 1946) have silver pin hinge closures. 
                  This kind of fastener (bracelet closure) was used by Spratling 
                  until 1946 for his &quot;production&quot; pieces. (Many of the 
                  bracelets made AFTER Spratling's death have inappropriate fasteners 
                  that are obviously not merely jewelry repairs).&nbsp; Spratling's 
                  earrings from 1931 - 1946 were hand made and the only &quot;purchased&quot; 
                  or mass produced finding was the actual screw on each earring.&nbsp; 
                  Only screw back earrings were made in Spratling's workshop during 
                  his lifetime. Early cuff links (circa 1933 - 1946) had a flat 
                  disc or circular &quot;button&quot; or even another identical 
                  decorative motif connected to each other with a few links of 
                  chain to form the cuff link.&nbsp; For commercial cuff links 
                  Spratling produced circa 1949 and later, he used a toggle fastener.&nbsp; 
                  These construction details did not vary.&nbsp;&nbsp;On early 
                  jewelry and object pieces, we should find some remaining evidence 
                  of filing marks where each piece was cut. At the time of production, 
                  every effort was made to smooth away these file marks, but when 
                  we look closely, we should be able to discern them. &nbsp;(Note 
                  the file marks on the early belt buckle in the photo on the 
                  left.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">(Notice the hinge 
                  on the finely crafted box - c. 1949 - below on the right in 
                  contrast with the cruder hinge from a c. 1940 box depicted in 
                  the photo on the left.)&nbsp; Some Spratling pieces are beautifully 
                  and finely constructed.&nbsp; Other examples of the same design 
                  may lack the finely finished touches or the fastidious workman<img src="photos/hinge_finer.jpg" width="300" height="189" align="right">ship.&nbsp; 
                  This is one of the charms of individually crafted pieces; no 
                  two are truly alike. Certainly, however, the piece that was 
                  created with greater attention to the fine details will always 
                  remain a more valuable piece over the same design that has been 
                  finished in a cruder fashion..&nbsp; <img border="0" src="photos/hinge_crude.jpg" align="left" width="200" height="109"></font></p>

            specifications, therefore, may result in a&nbsp;slightly lighter or heavier piece.&nbsp;
            If however, there is a considerable decrease (or increase) in weight
            in combination with poorly executed details in a
            piece, we should seek additional evidence of authenticity.</font></p>
